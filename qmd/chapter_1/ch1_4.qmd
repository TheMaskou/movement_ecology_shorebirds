Since 2021, our local automated Motus array is sitting both in the **Hunter** estuary and **Port Stephens** estuary, with respectively **eight** and **three** stations.

This page displays a dynamic map where you can explore for each station and its history.

You can also openly explore location and a few other aspects on [Motus server](https://motus.org/dashboard/#e=profile&d=projects&s=294&f=%7B%7D&t=stationsDeployed).

A Motus station is made of multiple components:

-   **Antenna** (either directional or omni-directionnal), to detect any VHF signal

-   **SensorGnome Receiver**, to identify and store VHF signal from a known or unknown tag

-   **Solar panel + battery** (low cycle 12V), to provide electrical power

-   **Mast**, to provide supporting structure

Note that you can build any station yourself by simply following the [installation guide](https://docs.motus.org/en/stations/station-installation) freely delivered by Motus.
